## Directory Projet API Specification

The goal of the repository is to provide a Swagger-based API specification representing the available possibilities of our distributed directory project.

The swagger.json and swagger.yaml are handling those representations. They have been generated using the associated editor at https://editor.swagger.io

The slim-server folder contains an example of an automatically generated php project compatible with the SLIM framework. A lot of different generation are available.
